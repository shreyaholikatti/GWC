      <h2>Bio</h2>
        My name is Shreya Holikatti and I am a rising junior at Granite Bay High School in Granite Bay, CA. I wanted to do Girls Who Code, because I spend so much time on the Internet that I've always wondered what goes on behind the scenes of the actual program I am running. Through Girls Who Code, I'm learning new and fascinating things each day that I wouldn't have gotten to experience elsewhere. Outside of school, I have been involved in a nonprofit organization-Cognitive Exchange- which teaches students in underprivileged areas speeech and debate skills. My experiences teaching classes of 20-30 high school and college students has taught me skills I don't think I could have learned elsewhere. From learning how to break down seemingly mindless concepts (such as what a thesis statement is) to keeping students older than me engaged in classes, it has helped me better my understanding of these concepts as well. Apart from Cognitive Exchange, I enjoy skiing, hiking, and hanging out with my friends and family in my free time. After being in multiple robotics leagues for the last seven years, I hope to pursue a career in engineering (possibly computer science).
